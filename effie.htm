     <b>Character</b>
    <br><br><br>
    Being an eccentric Capitol citizen, Effie has a unique and flamboyant interest in fashion, and is constantly seen throughout the series wearing colorful stylized outfits and wigs. She is regarded as a fashion icon amoungst the people of the Capitol, proceeding Katniss Everdeen's sucessful appearance in the 74th Hunger Games, and eventual victory. She is flighty, sometimes overly cheerful, and a master in Capitol protocol and manners. Effie tries to attempt to remain positive despite her taxing job being Peeta and Katniss' liaison to the Capitol, especially when she has the full knowledge that the two probably will never come back from the games alive. Even at the tense Reaping ceremony, she tries to bring levity in the drawing of names with her catchphrase: "Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor!" Of course, that’s easy for Effie to say – she’ll never have to step foot in the Arena, or live in the poverty of District 12.
      <br><br>
      In The Hunger Games, Effie Trinket has pink hair, speculated to be a wig, and during the reaping wears a spring-green suit. As she gives speeches, she constantly adjusts her attire. She grew up in the luxury, wealth, and splendor of Panem's Capitol. Panem is the post-apocalyptic nation that stands in the vestiges of North America. Unlike the 12 Districts that live in squalor and poverty under its tyrannical rule, the Capitol is a center of high culture, fashion, and affectation.

    <b>Skills</b> 
    
    <br><br><br>
   Effie is the Hunger Games escort for District 12. Effie randomly draws the names of District 12's participants for the Games, selecting one boy and one girl that will be sent to the Capitol to prepare for the Arena. In the 74th Hunger Games, she selects Peeta Mellark, a baker's son; and 12-year old Primrose Everdeen, but Prim’s sister Katniss Everdeen quickly volunteers to take her place. Effie takes it upon herself to make sure that her Tributes, Katniss and Peeta, are groomed before presenting themselves to the Capitol, and the rest of Panem, on TV.
      <br>
      But her interest is fashion. Effie is the most intense fashionista you'll ever meet, and even in a large crowd, chances are you'll spot her elaborate, vibrant dress. Even within the fashion-obsessed Capitol she is considered a model of trendiness. Ostentatious to an extreme, her signature calling card is her large pink wig.
      <br>
     The challenge for Effie is keeping up the spirits of her tributes, Katniss and Peeta, while managing their packed schedule. Effie’s biggest obstacle is Katniss herself. Katniss can be sullen and doesn’t like to have to explain herself to anyone, never mind to a TV camera, so preparing her for the big pre-Hunger Games interview is no small task. Toss in Katniss’ distaste for fashion, makeup, hair and practically any grooming past an occasional shower, and Effie is at her wit’s end.

    <b> Film Adaptation</b>
    <br><br><br>
    
    The name Effie is an Anglicisation of the Greek name Euphemia which means "All-Praised." This ties in to the many Greco-Roman references and allusions of the trilogy. 
      <br>
      Aside from all the unnamed tributes, Effie was the only other character whose name was not said in the film, even though she is a constant through the movie and her name is mentioned multiple times in the book. 
      <br>
      Elizabeth Banks, who portrays Effie in the film, has stated that her performance was inspired by actress, Rosalind Russell for her role in the 1958 classical film, Auntie Mame.
