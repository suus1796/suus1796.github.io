     <b>Character</b>
    <br><br><br>
      Haymitch is stubborn, temperamental, and frequently surly. He is often curt: “Here's some advice – stay alive.” But over the course of the Hunger Games, Haymitch becomes a true mentor to Katniss and Peeta. As a trainer, it's his job while in the Capitol to get sponsors for his Tributes. Sponsors provide much-needed weapons, medicine, and other supplies that are then flown into the arena. Haymitch (somewhat surprisingly) rises to the occasion on this front, but will it be enough to keep either Katniss or Peeta alive?
      <br><br>
      He grew up in District 12 of Panem. Panem is a futuristic nation set in the ruins of North America, while its District 12 is a poor mining section located in Appalachia. But he is living now in Victor's Village in Panem. A former winner of Panem's Hunger Games, an annual government-orchestrated battle-to-the-death that pits 12 boys and 12 girls from all the Districts of Panem against each other, Haymitch gets to live in a secluded neighborhood set aside for winners of that horrific contest. In Haymitch’s mind, the relatively nice digs (by District 12’s standards) are not much of a consolation, never mind a reward.

    <b>Skills</b> 
    
    <br><br><br>
        He is a trainer of all Hunger Games participants from District 12. As the only living Victor from District 12, Haymitch has to train its randomly drawn participants each year. It’s a job with a lot of downtime, which is both good and bad for him. Haymitch is quite handy with a knife, evidenced by when he killed two Career tributes. He is also quite intelligent, outsmarting his fellow tributes and making the Capitol look stupid with their own force field. He was remarkably strong and quite handsome when he was younger. Although he has low endurance, he is good at lying, as shown in his ability to keep Katniss clueless about the second rebellion. He can be convincing, persuading Districts 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11 to protect Katniss and manipulating command in District 13 to allow Katniss into combat. He was able to communicate with Katniss through his gifts in the arena, though Peeta believed that ability was due to the similarities in their personalities.
      <br>
      His interests are drinking. A lot. After returning from his Hunger Games, Haymitch became an isolated alcoholic. The horrors of the Games definitely took their toll on him.
      <br>
     The challenge for him is trying to keep his two tributes alive during their days in the arena. Originally unimpressed with Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the two Tributes from District 12, Haymitch gains some actual hope that they can be contenders. He strategizes with them, and prepares them for what they can expect.

    <b> Film Adaptation</b>
    <br><br><br>
    
    Unfortunatly there is not much information about the film and why they choose Woody Harrelson.
