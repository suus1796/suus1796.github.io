    This news leaves Katniss in shock, trying to gather herself. Not knowing what else to do, she volunteers her. Her sister freaks out and <a class="gale" href= "gale.htm" style="color: orangered">Gale</a> brings her to her mother. Continuing with the drawing of the tributes, the boy tribute is a boy named <a class="peetamellark" href= "peetamellark.htm" style="color:orangered"> Peeta Mellark</a>, who Katniss  barely knows, even though his actions are what turned her into the BA hunter she is to day. When they were younger Katniss' father died,and he mother was to shocked to do anything. Basically he gave her hope when no one else bothered looking at her.

The first people are Katniss' mom and sister, she basically reminds them what to trade for what, and then she reminds her mother she can't freeze up again, that she has to take care of prim. Then surprisingly Peeta's dad visits her, he brings her cookies and says he'll make sure Prim does not starve. After him it's the Mayor's daughter, Madge, she gives Katniss her pin and asks that she wear it. After her Gale comes in, all he does is hold her.

    Getting off the train, the tributes have to meet with their stylists, who are supposed to make them look as appealing as possible. Which includes a lot of waxing on their part. After the prep team is done with her, Katniss meats her stylist and discuses her outfit. Her stylist, Cinna, has a creative eye that could never be topped. His idea for her costume for the opening ceremony is to set her a blaze. Parts of her are actually on fire. Peeta is dressed identically, in a black jump suite and flaming head dress and cape, as they ride a golden chariot pulled by black horses, down the streets of the capital. The crowd roars with approval.

Katniss is scared out of her mind, even in the stunning dress Cinna made her. Cinna seams to be the only one who helped Katniss, even with the interviews. When it comes to her turn she is just honest. She has the crowd eating out of her hands by the time shes done. Then it Peeta's turn, he's humble and likable. But in the end the thing that really clutches the crowd is his confession of love for Katniss.
