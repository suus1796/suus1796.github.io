     <b>Character</b>
    <br><br><br>
    Not much is known about Prim's early life, but she is described as a compassionate young girl with blonde hair and blue eyes.
<br>
She was born on May 11th, and it is obvious from the beginning that Prim loves all living creatures. She saved a stray cat (whom Katniss tried to drown the second Prim brought him home) and named him Buttercup, insisting his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. Because of her love for animals, when Katniss once took her out in the woods beyond District 12 to teach her how to hunt and after successfully shooting a creature, Prim broke down in tears and wanted to help the dying animal.
<br>
Prim was also a good healer at an early age, often helping her mother with patients. Katniss noted that she never appeared to be fazed by wounds or nudity, even though she was "scared of her own shadow".
     

      <br><br>
      Prim loves all living creatures, even the most unsightly ones. She has a pet goat, Lady, that Katniss gave her as well as a gruesome, ugly cat she named Buttercup. Starving and swarming with parasites, Prim brought the wretched creature home one day. Katniss intended to drown him, but Prim begged so hard for Katniss to let him live that she decided to allow the cat to stay. She, like her mother, has a passion and talent for healing. Prim stayed at her mother's side even during the most horrid cases, even though she was "scared of her own shadow." According to Johanna Mason, after Katniss Everdeen won the 74th Hunger Games along with Peeta Mellark, all of Panem adored her.

    <b>Skills</b> 
    
    <br><br><br>
  Prim, we should note, is a nurturing, skilled healer. For example, she owns a sweet little goat named Lady, a formerly wounded animal Katniss rescued from being butchered many years ago. When Katniss brought the hurt goat home, Prim was able to bring it back from the edge of death by "grinding up herbs and coaxing brews down the animal's throat" 
      <br>
      Prim also had household chores and helped to take care of patients that people brought to her mother, the local healer. Later, after Katniss escaped from the Quarter Quell, she turned out to be a very skilled doctor while living in District 13. During the war, she would work with her mother in the hospital and then go out to help the injured in the midst of battle.
